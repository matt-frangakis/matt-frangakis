# Hi There!

Thanks for stopping by!

## I'm Matt Frangakis. Pleasure to make your acquantance.

I'm an aeronautical engineer by education and a software engineer by profession. I love applying engineering principles to software development, in order to solve real-world problems, specifically of an engineering nature; but to not just solve them, but solve them *scalably* and *reliably*. 

### I'm not looking to re-invent the wheel, but utilise tools that already exist to solve common problems.

I am a certified AWS Solutions Architect and Developer (both associate level), looking to take those certifications to the professional level and beyond in 2024. 

TypeScript, React, Next.js, SQL Server, MySQL and Python are known to me like the back of my hand. I'm slowly coming to grips with C# and the dotnet world.

## TL;DR

I love writing code in the language most appropriate for the context, that can be serverlessly deployed to the cloud in the most cost-efficient manner, while ensuring high-availability, scalability and reliability.
